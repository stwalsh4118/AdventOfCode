Insights:
    This one was also fairly easy to conceptualize
    Had difficulty with memory allocation of the 2d array, had to use malloc to allocate memory on the heap instead of the stack, apparently trying to initialize 1 million ints on the stack is a bad idea
    Learned how to make multidimensional arrays with pointers using an array of pointers to hold all of the arrays
    Learned more about how to pass arrays to functions
    Learned more about string manipulation, mostly splitting strings on delimiters

To run program:

Run executable

Input string that corresponds with your command list (strings in the form of "turn on/turn off/toggle x1,y1 through x2,y2" seperated by new lines)

Press Enter

Output will be:
    the total number of lights that are switched on after all of the commands are run
    the total brightnes of the lights after all the commands are run
