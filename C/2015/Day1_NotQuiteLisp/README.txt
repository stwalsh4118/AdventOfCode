Insights:
    My first foray into *actually* coding in C so it was a doosey getting used to syntax and remembering to put in semicolons.
    Learned how to use header files to make my code more reusable, very helpful for AoC due to the puzzle inputs working best from files so I can use the same function to read all of the inputs.
    Learned how to return multiple outputs with an array
    Learned about the stdbool library which makes booleans way easier
    Learned basics about string parsing and checking chars against other chars (i feel like im still doing things wrong here)

To run program:

Run executable

Input string that corresponds with your "instruction set" (must be only left or right parentheses)

Press Enter

Output will be which floor you end up on and whether or not you entered the basement, if you did, it will tell you on which instruction you entered the basement
