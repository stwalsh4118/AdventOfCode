Insights:
    This one felt easier than the two previous, probably because I've just been getting better and the skills used were language agnostic
    Learned more how to parse strings and check characters within the strings

To run program:

Run executable

Input string that corresponds with your words list (words list composed of strings seperated by a new line)

Press Enter

Output will be:
    the number of strings in your list that meet the conditions (see the puzzle definition to see the conditions)
    the number of strings in your list that meet the better conditions (see the puzzle definition to see the conditions)
