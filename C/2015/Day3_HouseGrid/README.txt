Insights:
    Learned a lot more about how to pass and use pointers through a lot of trial and error
    Learned how to dynamically expand and array with realloc (you need to store the size of the array forever though, I had the idea that I could make a struct to bascially create my own array that would hold the array and the arrays length and possibly other properties of the array)
     

To run program:

Run executable

Input string that corresponds with your directions (only single string of ^,v,<,>, no spaces)
