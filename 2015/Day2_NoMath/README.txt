Insights:
    Learned more string parsing like splitting strings via a delimiter
    Learned how to use structs to hold collections of data easier
    Used the number of lines to dynamically create the exact right size of array to hold all of my boxes

To run program:

Run executable

Input string that corresponds with your box dimensions (one per line, each dimension seperated by an 'x', e.g., 12x22x87)

Press Enter

Output will be:
    the amount of wrapping paper needed for each box (the surface area plus the area of the smallest side for some slack)
    the amount of ribbon needed to wrap the present plus a bow (calculated by the side with the smallest perimeter plus the volume of the box)
