Insights:
    This one was pretty annoying, I got the MD5 algorithm from github but parsing the results and changing the data types into stuff I knew how to use was a parsing
    Learned a lot about the string methods and using string pointers through trial and error
    Learned that you can return a pointer from a function if you use malloc in the function to allocate the memory for the pointer on the heap instead of the stack, useful for arrays and strings and probably other stuff I dont know about
    Learned about a bunch of new data types and how they are stored and converting between them

To run program:

Run executable

Input string that corresponds with your key (single string no spaces)

Press Enter

Output will be:
    the hash number added to the end of your string that gives us the MD5 hash that has 5 leading zeros
    the hash number added to the end of your string that gives us the MD5 hash that has 6 leading zeros
